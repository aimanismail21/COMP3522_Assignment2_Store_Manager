# todo Special Requirements
# The first time the store receives an order for an item, it is likely that it won't have the item in it's inventory since the store should be initialized with an empty inventory.
# In the event the store receives an order for an item that it does not have inventory for, then it should go ahead and get a 100 of those items made by the corresponding factory class.
